## Insights & Suggestions for Business Growth 🚀

### 1. **Targeting High Attrition Groups** 🎯
   - **Age Group**: The age group **26-35** has the highest attrition rate (116 employees).

### 2. **Improving Employee Satisfaction** 😌
   - **Laboratory Technicians** have a high satisfaction score (62) but still experience attrition. The company should explore ways to further improve job satisfaction for this role, such as providing more career progression paths, better working conditions, and reward systems for retention.
